# Search and View in Calendar Grid

## New Feature: Visual Calendar Integration! 🎯

Your search now displays events directly in the calendar grid for easy month-wise viewing.

## How It Works

### 1. Search for an Event
Type your search query in the "Search from my calendar" section:
- Search for "sale" to find all sales events
- Search for "winter" to find winter events
- Search for any event name

### 2. View Search Results
Results appear below the search box with:
- Event date
- Full event title
- Highlighted matching text

### 3. Click to Navigate
Click any search result and watch the magic:
- **Calendar jumps to that month** automatically
- **Event appears in the calendar grid** on the correct day
- **Cell is highlighted with red border** and pulsing animation
- **Event name shows inside the day cell**

### 4. Highlight Auto-Clears
The red highlight animation runs for **5 seconds** then automatically clears.

## Calendar Display Features

### Event Tags in Calendar
Each calendar day now shows:
- **Day number** at the top
- **Event tags** below (purple boxes with event names)
- **Up to 2 events** displayed
- **"+X more"** tag if more than 2 events on same day

### Special Styling
- **Today's date**: Purple gradient background with white event tags
- **Searched event**: Red border with pulsing animation
- **Event hover**: Full event title appears as tooltip
- **Truncated text**: Long event names are shortened with "..."

## Example Workflow

### Finding a Sale Event
1. Type "sale" in search box
2. See results: "Christmas Sale", "Winter Sale", "Black Friday Sale"
3. Click "Christmas Sale"
4. Calendar navigates to December
5. December 25th is highlighted in red
6. "Christmas Sale" appears in the day cell
7. Highlight clears after 5 seconds

## Visual Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Purple gradient cell | Today's date |
| Red border + pulse | Search result (5 sec) |
| Purple event tag | Regular event |
| White event tag | Event on today's date |
| Gray "+X more" | Additional events on that day |

## Calendar Grid View

Each month displays events month-wise:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Mon  Tue  Wed  Thu  Fri  Sat  Sun  │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1    2    3    4    5    6    7   │
│                   [Sale]            │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  8    9   10   11   12   13   14   │
│            [Event]                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Tips

### Best Practices
- **Search first**, then browse calendar visually
- **Click search results** instead of manually navigating months
- **Hover over event tags** to see full names
- **Use short keywords** for broader search results

### Multiple Events on Same Day
If a day has 3+ events:
- First 2 events show as tags
- "+1 more" (or +2, +3, etc.) indicates additional events
- Check "Upcoming Events" list below for full details

## Mobile Experience

On mobile devices:
- Event tags are smaller but still readable
- Day cells adjust to screen size
- Search and navigation work the same
- Tap instead of click for all interactions

## Search + Calendar = Powerful Combo

This integration gives you the best of both worlds:
1. **Fast search** to find specific events
2. **Visual calendar** to see context and nearby events
3. **Month-wise view** to understand timing
4. **Quick navigation** without manual clicking

Perfect for planning and tracking your live operations! 🚀
